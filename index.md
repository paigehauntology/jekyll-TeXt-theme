### Hi there! I am a third-year undergradauate student @ NYU studying data science and sociology.

My passions lie in human-computer interaction, critical disability studies and digital accessibility. I am currently pursuing independent research on the effects of digital health tracking as a form of surveillance against disabled populations. I am also a disabled cyborg, amateur biohacker, and avid bookworm. Check out what I am currently reading [here.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46515398-paige-h)

This website is meant to be acessible and readable for **everyone.** As I learn more about web accessibility, I will keep updating this site with more of my designs and glimpses of my creative mind.
