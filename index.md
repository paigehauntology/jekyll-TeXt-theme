### Hi there! I am a data science and sociology undergraduate @ NYU

My passions lie in human-computer interaction, critical disability studies and digital accessibility. I am currently pursuing independent research on the effects of digital health tracking as a form of surveillance against disabled populations. I am also a disabled cyborg, amateur biohacker, and avid bookworm.
