The diabetic body, when connected to an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor produces thousands of data points each day that are fed into algorithms that assess our physiological state and is then interpreted by medical practitioners using telemedecine. My research analyzes the privacy tradeoff and the impacts of health data-sharing on the construction of the medical gaze. Who has access to my bodyâ€™s data? How might my health data be used to discriminate against me as a disabled person?
