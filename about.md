#### There is so much I want to tell you --- but I will just include some personal highlights. 


I have an unconventional relationship with technology; I call myself a disabled cyborg because as a type-one diabetic I wear an open-source [Artificial Pancreas System (APS)](https://openaps.org). Through tinkering with and hacking into my own assistive technology, I nurtured a love for DIY engineering and human-computer interaction. I am curious about algorithms, not because my major requires me to study them, but because an algorithm is what allows my body to function everyday.
