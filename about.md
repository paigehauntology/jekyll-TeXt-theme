#### There is so much I want to tell you --- but I will just include some personal highlights. 


I have an unconventional relationship with technology; I call myself a disabled cyborg because as a type-one diabetic I wear an open-source [Artificial Pancreas System (APS)](https://openaps.org). Through tinkering with and hacking into my own assistive technology, I nurtured a love for DIY engineering and human-computer interaction. I am curious about algorithms, not because my major requires me to study them, but because an algorithm is what allows my body to function everyday. I hack into my own body, and in the acquire special epistemic access to the world of design and engineering.

I am a science-fiction nerd and disciplined world builder. As a student, I inherit the task of sociologists to "imagine otherwise." Through my love of fiction and experience of navigating a world that wasn't built for my body, I am constantly expanding my imaginative capacity to create new worlds or modes of being. 

**My study of data science and software engineering does not exist independently as a disabled, bookworm who hacks into her own body. I am curious in the ways my cyborg body translates to human-technology relationships we encounter in our labor. I am constantly imagining new ways of existing.**
